# login_html_css

This is the latest project for the HTML and CSS course at the Tech Academy.

I found that the "Remember me on this computer." font was taking a larger size, so I added a class in the span tag to modify this to something that looked like the example. I modified the CSS so that it would change sizes from 12px to 10px when the size of the screen changed.
